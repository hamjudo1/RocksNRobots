This is the RocksNRobots flying robot camp.

The arduino that we use is the digispark. 

In order to install the digistump arduino program, follow the instructions here
http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting
Once you finish installing the software, you are ready to start programming your arduino.

Once you have your software installed, do the projects in the examples folder.
Do the projects in order, starting with Blink.
The Digispark is different from the helicopter circuit board because the Digispark was plugged right into the computer
and gets it power from the computer, yet the helicopter circuit board is plugged into the computer but is powered by a seperate battery that you plug in seperatly once the Arduino says to plug in.
